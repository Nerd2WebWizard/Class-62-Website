    <h1>Hi</h1>
    <h2> I am Shourya And I Am Going To Tell You About My Favourite Hobby</h2>
    <img src = "fortnite image.jpeg" >
    <p>My favourite hobby, as you might already be able to guess from the picture, is Fortnite.
    I love it for many reasons, and one of them is the fact that it is a FFA (free for all) gun game
    that as everlasting fun. I have lots of fun playing this amazing game, playing battle royale and other
    creative gamemodes such as the Pit. There are also multiple other games in fortnite creative gamemodes, 
    which include parkour and other stunt trickshots. There are many devices from which you can play the game from,
    and it lists from computer, phone, Xbox, Playstation, Nitendo Switch and other. But I use Nitendo Switch controller to play 
    this spectacular game.
